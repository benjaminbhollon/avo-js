## Welcome to AvoJS

AvoJS is a simple, un-opinionated, and lightweight library for adding callbacks to function changes. Weighing in at under 400 bytes, it's easily small enough to use without worry.

### Potential use cases

- Automatically updating an HTML element's content when a variable's value changes (see example below).
- Updating the page whenever new information becomes available (for example, if you request information from an API and set the variable in a callback, it can automatically update the page)
- Validating input as soon as it happens
- Best of all, being able to combine multiple implementations. The same function could be called, for example, on user input, AJAX callback, and everywhere else that a variable's value is changed.

This is a _non-comprehensive_ list. It was just me thinking up a few possibilities right after finishing the first version. Please do [let me know your implementation](https://seewitheyesclosed.com/contact/) so I can add it! I look forward to hearing about this being used in ways I never foresaw.

### Installation

You can include AvoJS in your application with the following script tag:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/benjaminbhollon/avo-js@1/avo.min.js"></script>
```

Really, though, AvoJS is so lightweight (Under 400 bytes!) that you should be able to host it yourself with zero problems. Just download `avo.min.js` from [the repository](https://github.com/benjaminbhollon/avo-js) and include it in a script tag. Honestly, it's so small that you could put it in an inline script tag and suffer very few negative consequences.

### Usage

AvoJS has a special syntax for variables, but it's not too hard to get the hang of. It goes like this:

```js
avo(varName);
```

Note that there is no need to declare AvoJS variables (and it may even cause problems if you do). Just start using them and it will work smoothly.

To set/get the value of your AvoJS variable, use `avo(varName).value`. If you forget to use the `value` property, it will throw an error. `avo(varName).value` can be treated pretty much like a normal JS variable and function properly.

Now, if you don't add a callback, there's no reason to use AvoJS. So here's how you bind a callback to a AvoJS variable:

```js
avo(varName).bind(callback);
```

That's it. From now on whenever you assign the value of `avo(varName).value`, the callback function will run.

Please note that the callback will only run for assignments _after_ it has been bound to the variable. On the plus side, this means that you can change the callback at a later point in execution. Just run `avo(varName).bind(callback)` with your new callback.

### Example

In this example, we will use AvoJS to automatically update the header of a document (with the id `documentHeader`) with the value of a text input (with the id `documentHeaderInput`).

Here is the HTML:

```html
<h1 id="documentHeader">Untitled</h1>
<input type="text" value="Untitled" id="documentHeaderInput">

<!--Include avo.min.js-->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/benjaminbhollon/avo-js@1/avo.min.js"></script>
<!--Include the JS we'll be writing below-->
<script type="text/javascript" src="script.js"></script>
```

Pretty simple. Now here's the JS:

```js
avo('documentTitle').value = "Untitled"; // Sets to Untitled -- Note that this will not update the header because we have not yet bound the callback. You can bind the callback before assigning the variable's value as well, which _would_ update the header.

//When the document title changes, update the page header
avo('documentTitle').bind(() => {
  document.getElementById("documentTitle").innerText = avo('documentTitle');.value;
});

//Listen for user changes the title to the text input
document.getElementById('documentTitleInput').addEventListener('input', () => {
  avo('documentTitle').value = this.value; // This will automatically trigger the callback and update the header to match
});
```

Pretty easy. But I believe that coding's beauty is in its ability to simplify complex problems into small chunks. This 400-byte library (!!!) is powerful enough to be useful in endless use-cases. I originally wrote it for use in a social media app that I'm coding and for a messaging app my friend is making.
